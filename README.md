A automated devops pipeline that can be modified easily, so can be reused for deploying and running services, just by using through github actions or command line

This is a copy of a deployed pipeline through my uni email, this repo can be found here https://github.com/s21507BBacon/Bryce-Bacon-sit722-part5.git
